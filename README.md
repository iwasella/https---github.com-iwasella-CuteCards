This was a personal project where you create cute cards!
You can do the following:
- Change the backgroung image of the cards (I drew them in Adobe Photoshop)
- Change the text image 
- Save Image
- Send an Email (make sure to put the Save the Card and put in in the email before sending it out!!)

Thank you! 
Clicking on the images will play a song I got from Youtube Creator Studio.
The images are from Pinterest.
